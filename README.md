One of the biggest troubles for understanding or beginning malware analysis for others is the lack of having complete sample(s) as most books repos only focus on the dropped executiable and not the initial payload(s). The aim of this repository is to have a collection of live samples with all the additional payloads or potential payloads for use in learning how to reverse engineer, deobfuscate, and improve your REM skills. 

The samples contained in this archive are in various formats such Powershell, JScript, VBA Macro code, C#, C++, and etc. These samples were obtained through various malware DBs with their file extension removed and the file being renamed with it's associating SHA256 hash or malware family name.
